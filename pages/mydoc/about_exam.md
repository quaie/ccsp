20 years IT experience<br>
started as helpdesk @ an ISP, at the beginning of Y2K<br>
continued as network engineer<br>
switched to app operations/engineering<br>
Python/Bash savvy<br>
Linux guy (although my workstation was almost always Window$ :))



BSc IT & Computing<br>
currently studying MSc Cybersecurity<br>
various industry certifications (not too many though :))<br>
