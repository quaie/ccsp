**_Certification Exam Outline_**

`5.1 Build and implement physical and logical infrastructure for cloud environment`
> - Hardware specific security configuration requirements (e.g., hardware security module (HSM) and Trusted Platform Module (TPM))
- Installation and configuration of management tools
- Virtual hardware specific security configuration requirements (e.g., network, storage, memory, central processing unit (CPU), Hypervisor type 1 and 2)
> - Installation of guest operating system (OS) virtualization toolsets

`5.2 Operate and maintain physical and logical infrastructure for cloud environment`
> - Access controls for local and remote access (e.g., Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), secure terminal access, Secure Shell (SSH), console-based access mechanisms, jumpboxes, virtual client)
- Secure network configuration (e.g., virtual local area networks (VLAN), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), virtual private network (VPN))
- Network security controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), honeypots, vulnerability assessments, network security groups, bastion host)
- Operating system (OS) hardening through the application of baselines, monitoring and remediation (e.g., Windows, Linux, VMware)
- Patch management
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) strategy
- Availability of clustered hosts (e.g., distributed resource scheduling, dynamic optimization, storage clusters, maintenance mode, high availability (HA))
- Availability of guest operating system (OS)
- Performance and capacity monitoring (e.g., network, compute, storage, response time)
- Hardware monitoring (e.g., disk, central processing unit (CPU), fan speed, temperature)
- Configuration of host and guest operating system (OS) backup and restore functions
> - Management plane (e.g., scheduling, orchestration, maintenance)
